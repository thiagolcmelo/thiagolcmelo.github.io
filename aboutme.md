My name is Thiago Melo. I am a software engineer working on the data engineering space.

- Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer
- Python and Scala Developer
- Master of Science in Physics

### my history

I am a big entusiast of machine learning, understanding how the algorithms work under the hood, creating prototypes for checking new ideas, and deploying projects to production.

When I was young, I dreamed about being a scientist. This dream sticked to the back of my head until my late 20's, when I finally got a master's degree in physics, and realized that maybe this thing of science was not my calling. Good thing is that my past self left a nice mathematical background to me, and I am very grateful to him.
