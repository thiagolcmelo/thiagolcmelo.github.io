## My history

When I was young, I dreamed about being a scientist. This dream sticked to the back of my head until my late 20's, when I finally got a master's degree in physics, and realized that maybe this thing of science was not my calling. Good thing is that my past self left a nice mathematical background to me, and I am very grateful to him.

I am a big entusiast of machine learning, understanding how the algorithms work under the hood, creating prototypes for checking new ideas, and deploying projects to production.
